### new `rmacroRDM` workflow

To use new **`rmacroRDM` functions** and workflow, see new [vignette](https://cdn.rawgit.com/annakrystalli/Brain_size_evolution/master/match_workflow.nb.html) with project specific working example (file .Rmd in **`match_workflow.Rmd`**)  

Script extracted from **`match_workflow.Rmd`** is saved in **`match_workflow.R`**

<br>


### rendering & extracting code from .Rmd

Use script **`render.R`** to:
- extract code from **`match_workflow.Rmd`** using `knitr::purl`
- render **`match_workflow.Rmd`** to html_notebook. Modify to render to other outputs.
